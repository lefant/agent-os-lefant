name: Global Architecture Principles
description: Implement library-first, modular architecture with clear separation of concerns, testable code, and composable workflows. Use this skill when writing or editing backend libraries (lib/ directory), server actions (app/actions/), workflow orchestration code, authentication flows, or any code that needs to be testable in isolation. Also use when refactoring existing code to improve modularity, extracting duplicated logic, creating new API integrations, or designing multi-step processes. Apply these principles when structuring modules, passing authentication tokens, handling errors consistently, or ensuring environment-agnostic library functions.

# Global Architecture Principles

## When to use this skill:

- Writing or editing library code in the `lib/` directory (e.g., `lib/workflows/`, `lib/extract/`, `lib/process/`)
- Creating or modifying server actions in `app/actions/`
- Implementing workflow orchestration that composes multiple library modules
- Building authentication flows or handling token/credential management
- Refactoring existing code to improve testability and modularity
- Extracting duplicated logic into shared utility modules
- Creating new integrations with external APIs or services
- Designing multi-step processes that need clear input/output contracts
- Setting up error handling patterns across modules
- Structuring code for integration testing in isolation
- Creating environment-agnostic functions that receive configuration as parameters
